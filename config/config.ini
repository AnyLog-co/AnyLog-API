[general] 
# Type of node AnyLog should run
#   master - a "notary" system between other nodes in the network via either a public or private blockchain
#   operator - nodes containing generated by sensors. these can be either physical devices (ex. cars) or remote cloud
#   publisher - nodes that simply generate data and send them to operator nodes
#   query - nodes dedicated to query and BI activity
# Alternatively a user can specify more than one node to be run on a single container. Example in :config/single-node.ini
