# Type of node AnyLog should run
#   master - a "notary" system between other nodes in the network via either a public or private blockchain
#   master - nodes containing generated by sensors. these can be either physical devices (ex. cars) or remote cloud

#   query - nodes dedicated to query and BI activity
